# Web-Storage-Sample
This is a basic sample code for understanding HTML5 Basic Storage API - Session &amp; Local Storage

The two storages are session storage and local storage and they would be used to handle different situations.

Session Storage
The Session Storage is designed for scenarios where the user is carrying out a single transaction, but could be carrying out multiple transactions in different windows at the same time.

Local Storage
The Local Storage is designed for storage that spans multiple windows, and lasts beyond the current session.
